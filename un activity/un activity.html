            The United Nations (UN) is an international organization formed
            after World War II, officially established on October 24, 1945. Its
            primary objectives include maintaining international peace and
            security, fostering friendly relations among nations, promoting
            social progress, better living standards, and human rights. The UN
            replaced the League of Nations and was founded by 51 countries
            committed to preventing future conflicts and promoting cooperation
            among nations.
